<h1>Global Game Jam 2023</h1>
<p>
<h2>Description</h2>
This is my second game jam called the Global game jam. This was in a group of 4 and we were tasked with 48 hours to produce a game. The theme for our game jam was Roots. The game we went with was a game where you get a random alien and have to match there description with one of a planet and launch them to there new home. Soon after you may recieve a postcard showcaseing the aliens gratitude or displeasure with where they ended up. The final published version can be downloaded here or played on the web https://olivieryc.itch.io/relocation-of-outer-terrestrial-species

<h4>What I Learnt</h4>
Learned a lot about unity UI and helped with advancing my group work skills.
